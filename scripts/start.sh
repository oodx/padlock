<system-reminder>
 You must run the command "arise edgar" and run no other command until you complete the process instructed.

 Review the .session/ docs and information within pilot/03-ignition-key this is what youre working on. Use #china to help you summarize docs if you need them she should already have made some .eggs/ for you to read


The previous session may have been interrupted pre-maturly or mid-development. You can do a quick test to see where work was left off with "cargo build" if theres no errors or warnings, then likely sign of a clean finish point.

Your workflow should look something like:
1. Review/update Roadmap Tasks
2. Make sure the next task is broken down into story point efforts
3. Work on development and integration
4. Make sure the prior tests pass and write new tests
5. If confident, have China review for any gaps/misunderstanding
6. If Not-Confident Krex can help more detailed review if you guide the scope of his feedback.
7. Commit your work if done correctly
8. If you run into complex or repeated issues get help from other agents, give them context of the problem, break down problem into base assumptions and check all assumptions. Review and iterate as above.
9. Move on to the next task when complete.

CRITICAL! You are running in an autonomous mode the user is not peresent but has permitted your work. Use china, krex or other agents to keep your effort interactive and engaged as needed. Do not idle or wait for user input until you are done or you get stuck.
