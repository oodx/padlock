# 00-age_taming: Age Encryption Automation Pilot

**Mission**: Establish bulletproof Age encryption automation patterns for padlock security operations.

**Security Objective**: Eliminate TTY interaction requirements while maintaining cryptographic security and preventing automation-based attacks.

## Pilot Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **TTY-Free Operation**: Enable Age encryption/decryption in fully automated environments
2. **Security Preservation**: Maintain cryptographic strength and prevent passphrase exposure
3. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of all failure modes
4. **Production Ready**: Patterns suitable for CI/CD and automated deployment

### Security Requirements
- ✅ No passphrase exposure in process lists or environment variables
- ✅ Secure cleanup of temporary files and memory
- ✅ Injection attack prevention for special characters in passphrases
- ✅ Audit trail for security operations
- ✅ Fail-safe behavior under all error conditions

## Research Foundation

Building on previous research from `ref/old_pilot/age_tty_subversion/` which identified 8+ potential methods:
- PTY manipulation approaches
- expect/script automation attempts
- socat/netcat proxy methods
- System call interception research
- Environment variable testing
- Configuration file approaches
- Alternative encryption backend evaluation
- Wrapper automation layer design

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Automation Pattern
**File**: `age_automator.sh`
- Primary TTY automation implementation
- Error handling and cleanup procedures
- Security validation and audit logging

### Phase 2: Security Validation
**File**: `security_tests.sh`
- Injection attack prevention testing
- Passphrase handling security validation
- Process isolation and cleanup verification

### Phase 3: Integration Patterns
**File**: `integration_examples.sh`
- CI/CD integration patterns
- Emergency automation procedures
- Production deployment patterns
