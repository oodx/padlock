prompt: the padlock script is a sophisticated security tool, it partially works but its a bit of a mess. have china providea summary of the tool and its status. she can avoid the main padlock.sh script as this is a 4000+ line shell file,instead she can review the parts/ where the live code is. this is using bashfx build.sh pattern which means partsare built to final output. docs provide bashfx architecture which china can summarize as well.  the pilot folder and pilot script is our attempt to test various security patterns and fixes due to a limiation in age -p not acceptingtty inputs, so we tested various approaches. this is a sophiscated script. but hopefully the docs and egg summariesfrom china help clarify. as it is, it has a problem with irrecoverably locking repos, and does not follow itscorrect protocol so its generally unsafe to run on a repo that is not sufficiently checked in pushed to remote. fortesting gitsim is prerfered or even a stub fake git repo. do not use on live code. you can have Edgar and Krex bothhelp with security and defect analysis once china has completed her summaries
