# Milestone 2 Expanded: CRUD Operations & Lifecycle Management

**Security Guardian**: Edgar - Comprehensive CRUD operations for padlock integration  
**Mission**: Implement complete encryption lifecycle management with robust Age automation  
**Integration Target**: Replace TODO stubs in padlock with production-ready operations  

---

## 🎯 CRUD OPERATIONS ANALYSIS

### Core Padlock Requirements
Based on roadmap analysis and TODO stub identification, padlock requires these operations:

#### **Primary Operations** (Core CRUD)
1. **CREATE**: `lock()` - Encrypt files/repositories with Age
2. **READ**: `status()` - Check encryption status and repository state  
3. **UPDATE**: `rotate()` - Key rotation while maintaining access
4. **DELETE**: `unlock()` - Decrypt files (controlled access)

#### **Authority Management** (From Lucas's pilot)
5. **ALLOW**: `allow()` - Add recipients to authority chain
6. **REVOKE**: `revoke()` - Remove recipients from authority chain
7. **RESET**: `reset()` - Emergency repository unlock/reset

#### **Lifecycle Management** 
8. **VERIFY**: `verify()` - Integrity checking and validation
9. **EMERGENCY**: `emergency-unlock()` - Fail-safe recovery operations
10. **BATCH**: Bulk operations for directories/repositories

## 🎯 INTEGRATION WITH PADLOCK COMMANDS

### Command Mapping
```bash
# Direct replacements for TODO stubs:
padlock lock <files>        → CrudManager::lock()
padlock unlock <files>      → CrudManager::unlock()  
padlock status              → CrudManager::status()
padlock allow <recipient>   → CrudManager::allow_recipient()
padlock revoke <recipient>  → CrudManager::revoke_recipient()

// Bridge to Lucas's authority patterns:
impl CrudManager {
    fn bridge_to_authority(&self) -> &AuthorityManager {
        // Integrate with Lucas's proven authority_manager.sh patterns
        // via adapter pattern for clean separation
    }
