### üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL FOUNDATION

#### Key Files Implemented:
- `src/authority/mod.rs` - Authority module coordination
- `src/authority/chain.rs` - Core authority chain data structures
- `src/authority/ignition.rs` - Ignition key management with secure wrapping
- `src/authority/validation.rs` - Authority validation engine with proofs
- `src/authority/operations.rs` - Key generation operations (NEW)
- `src/authority/bridge/age_integration.rs` - Integration with Age automation

#### Architecture Highlights:
- Mathematical precision in authority hierarchy validation
- Cryptographic fingerprinting with SHA256
- Integration bridges preserving proven TTY automation patterns
- Comprehensive audit logging and security validation
- Factory patterns for clean instantiation

### üìä COMMIT HISTORY
- `feat: Implement core authority infrastructure (Milestone 1)`
- `feat: Implement authority-Age integration bridge (Story 2.4)`
- `feat: Implement authority key generation operations (Story 2.1)`

### üéØ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
1. **Story 2.2: Authority Chain Operations** (4 pts) - Core chain manipulation
2. **Milestone 3: Command Interface** (10 pts) - User-facing operations
3. **China comprehensive review** - Strategic assessment of progress
4. **Security validation and testing** - Ensure robustness

### üí° STRATEGIC NOTES
- Krex recommended prioritizing Integration Bridge as "force multiplier" ‚úÖ
- Foundation is mathematically precise and cryptographically sound
- All implementations build on proven Age automation patterns
- Ready for command interface implementation and user testing

### üîß TECHNICAL STATUS
- ‚úÖ All code compiles successfully (warnings only, no errors)
- ‚úÖ Proper dependency management (rand, sha2, hex, chrono)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling throughout
- ‚úÖ Test coverage for key generation scenarios
- ‚úÖ Audit logging integrated across all operations

**Session Conclusion**: Successfully implemented secure key generation operations with comprehensive validation. Foundation is rock-solid for continuing with authority chain operations and command interface in next session.
